# Vim 8.x Configuration and Notes
My super minimal Vim configuration, with [quick thoughts on plugins](plugins.md) and [a scratch pad of useful commands](vimnotes.md).

I've slowly reduced all customizations and instead have spent time learning Vim and related Linux tools.  And for everything else I go to VSCode or Eclipse depending on language.

NeoVim stuff is in [dotfiles](https://github.com/rocketnewton/dotfiles).
