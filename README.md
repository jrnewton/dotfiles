# dotfiles

Configuration, customization and scripts for my dev setup.  My [vimrc file](.vim/.vimrc) will bore you to tears, my [init.lua](.config/nvim/init.lua) for neovim is slightly more interesting.  In general I like bending to the tool's design (which is hopefully reflected in the default settings) rather than going heavy on customization.
