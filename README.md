Configuration, customization and scripts for more (mostly) Linux dev setup.  My [vimrc file](.vim/.vimrc) will bore you to tears, my [init.vim](.config/nvim/init.vim) for neovim is slightly more interesting but mostly centered on configuring coc.vim.  In general I like bending to the tool's design (which is hopefully reflected in the default settings) rather than going heavy on customization.
